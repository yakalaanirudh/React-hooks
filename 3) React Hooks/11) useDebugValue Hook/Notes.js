/*
In our App The first Name uses a custom hook called useLocalStorage
and the last Name uses a normall useState

If we go react dev tools next to last name its current value appears but it wont for first name.
For first name we need to go inside it.

Usedebug value enables react to display the current value of custom hook next to it

USEDEBUG VALUE WORKS ONLY IN CUSTOM HOOKS


*/

/*
Inside useLocalStorage we use useDebugValue we pass into it  argument 
The argument is the value we want to appear next to it in the reactc dev tools (i.e the current state)
